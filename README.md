# Intermediate Agile Software Development Textbook Resources

This textbook is intended for an intermediate-level software
development course at the undergraduate level that teaches software
engineering principles and practice following the Agile philosophy.

The textbook provides resources for both the instructor and their
students. Course preparation materials are provided for the instructor
and class presentation slides, assignments, and take-home exams are
provided for students.

However, instructor could email the authors (cgunay or adolocm at gmail.com) to get access to hidden materials such as quizzes.

## Publishing technology

The content is rendered and published using a static site generator
(or [Jamstack](https://jamstack.org/)) system
called [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). It is primarily built by combining
two Hugo
themes, [Techdoc](https://themes.gohugo.io/hugo-theme-techdoc/)
and [reveal-hugo](https://themes.gohugo.io/reveal-hugo/). Techdoc
provides the documentation-style browsing of book chapters and
reveal-hugo provides the capability of online accessible chapter
presentations using the [reveal.js](https://revealjs.com/) technology.

The generated site can then be hosted on any static host (such
as [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/)
or [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)). The original repository is
rendered and hosted on Github Pages and it is automatically generated
at each push by
using [Github's Actions](https://github.com/features/actions)
feature. You can see it in action in
[this example](https://soft-eng-practicum.github.io/softdev2-resources/).

## How to adopt this book and customize for your class

You can _fork_ this repository on Github and customize the chapters and
slides. See the links above to learn more about the different
technologies used.

Once you fork this repository, Github will carry over the Github
Actions instructions needed for automatic deployment, but you would
need to click on the "Actions" tab and enable them again in the
fork. After this, you should see the "Hugo" action listed, which will
be executed after each of your commits. The action will run Hugo and
write its output to the root of the `gh-pages` branch.

To enable Github Pages render this output, you need to go to the
Settings tab, scroll down and select to produce the pages from the
root folder of the `gh-pages` branch.

Don't forget to edit the `config.toml` file for changing variables
such as `baseURL`, `github_repository`, `github_doc_repository`,
`author`, `course`, and `google_analytics_id`.

## Installation

Hugo's installation instructions can be found
[here](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing).
Hugo is available in most Linux package managers and homebrew, although the
version found in package managers for Debian and Ubuntu is often outdated. The
instructions also include a video for installing on Windows.

The `Techdoc` and `reveal-hugo` themes are included in the repository as git
submodules under the `/themes/` directory. After cloning the repo, you will need
to run the following to download the submodules:
```sh
$ git submodule update --init --recursive
```

Then run the following to start the Hugo server:
```sh
$ hugo server
```

You should be prompted with a link to access the site in your browser. Hugo will
automatically detect modified files, rebuild the site, and refresh your browser.

## Reveal-Hugo customizations

In the class presentations, the `author` and `course` front-matter
variables will take precendence over the values in the `config.toml`
file. They are used in the following
custom
[Hugo shortcodes](https://gohugo.io/content-management/shortcodes/)
that we defined:

- `reveal-titlepage`: Puts the chapter title, course name (`course`
  parameter in page or in `config.toml` file), authors (`author`
  parameter), with an option to display a cover image, followed by the
  `reveal-prevnext-links` shortcode. The default format for the title
  page and its contents, such as authors can be changed in
  `layouts/shortcodes/reveal-titlepage.html`. It accepts the following
  optional parameters with the regular HTML syntax `param="value"`:
  - `figure`: Displays the cover image specified at given
    URL. If you create an image `/static/images/image.jpg`, you can
    refer to it with the base URL like this:
    `figure="/softdev2-resources/images/image.jpg"`.
  - `height`: Change the default height of `"300px"`.
  - `class`: Change CSS `class` of the `figure` tag.
  - `link`: Make the figure a link to this URL.
  - `alt`: Provide an alternate text to image.
  - `title`: Create a `<figcaption>` tag under the image.
  - `caption`: Set `alt` and also write it under the `figcaption`.
  - `attr`: Attribution text, shows up after caption.
  - `attrlink`: Link for the attribution.

- `reveal-prevnext-links`: Inserts links to previous and next Reveal
  chapters, which are automatically determined by following the pages
  in the folders. It has no additional options.
